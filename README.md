# Summarization

Description:

In this assignment, we'll be diving deeper into more advanced architectures of neural networks, which have helped in the field of summarization. There are two types of summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization entails concatenating extracts from a sentence/corpus to form a summary, whereas abstractive summarization.

1.   Unidirectional LSTM Encoder-Decoder
2.   Tensorboard Visualizations
3.   Unidirectional LSTM Encoder Decoder with Attention
4.   Unidirectional LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Attention and Beam Search
